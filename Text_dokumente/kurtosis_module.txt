here’s a quick who’s-who of those tools and what they’re for (plus when you’d use them on a local eth network):

assertoor — test/assertion runner for Ethereum networks; you declare conditions (e.g., finality in X epochs, no missed proposals, fee revenue above Y) and it continuously checks them. Great for validating upgrades or attack experiments.

broadcaster — generic name for utilities that push signed messages/txs to the network. In practice this might mean a simple raw-tx pusher or beacon message broadcaster (e.g., beaconcha.in’s tool for BLS-to-execution or voluntary exits). Use it when you want to inject pre-signed payloads without running extra clients.

tx_fuzz — transaction spammer/fuzzer that stress-tests EL mempools and txpool logic with randomized txs. Handy for DoS/“gas griefing” experiments. 
ethpandaops.io

custom_flood — configurable spammer mode in the Kurtosis ethereum-package; lets you tune flood frequency to shape baseline load. 
NewReleases

forkmon — “fork monitor” that watches a set of EL nodes to see if any drift out of consensus; useful during fault-injection. 
Artifact Hub

blockscout — full EVM block explorer (addresses, txs, logs, contracts); recent versions include blob/4844 awareness. Great for inspecting what your spam is doing.

dora — lightweight beacon-chain slot explorer; quick visibility into slots/epochs without a heavy backend. 
GitHub

full_beaconchain_explorer — a full beacon explorer stack (e.g., Bitfly’s open-source beaconcha.in backend) that indexes validators, attestations, rewards, etc. Use when you need historical/validator-level CL analytics.

prometheus_grafana — prewired metrics + dashboards in Kurtosis; gives you infra/clients/mev views out of the box. 
docs.kurtosis.com

prometheus — metrics scraper/time-series DB for your nodes (scrapes EL/CL/exporters). 
Prometheus

grafana — dashboarding/alerts on top of Prometheus (and more). 
Grafana Labs

tempo — Grafana’s distributed tracing backend; pair with JSON-RPC / client tracing to follow request paths under load. 
Grafana Labs

blobscan — explorer focused on EIP-4844 blob transactions; useful if your tests include blob traffic.

dugtrio — fault-tolerant CL API load-balancer that routes requests to healthy beacon nodes, with client-aware routing and rate-limits. Perfect in noisy tests. 
GitHub
+1

blutgang — ethPandaOps CL tooling suite used for beacon-chain simulations/analysis and protocol testing. Use it when you need deeper CL-focused experiments. 
GitHub

forky — live fork-choice visualizer for the beacon chain; great to see reorganizations or head-changes while you attack. 
ethpandaops.io

apache — classic HTTP server/reverse proxy you might use as a simple front or static host in front of explorers or dashboards. 
httpd.apache.org

nginx — high-performance web server/reverse proxy/load balancer; commonly used as the front door for RPCs/dashboards. 
Nginx

tracoor — beacon-chain trace collector/ETL: ingests CL data (blocks/attestations/gossip) for analysis. Useful for post-mortems. 
HackMD

spamoor — modern blob/tx spammer (successor to goomy-blob) for sustained or burst load, including multi-RPC fan-out. Ideal for crafting your baseline traffic.
